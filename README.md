# ZKTeco
Task for ZKTeco

To run the code please initiate a Virtual environment.
Once the virtual environment is set, clone this repository in the environment and install the requirements by running
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

Once all the required packages are installed run command "python manage.py runserver" from the same location as the manage.py file.

Then open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" in a browser. A text will appear with the lable "String".

Type in the desired string in it and hit "OK" button. You will redirected to another page with the Output displayed there.

I have not used any HTMl components and I am displaying it plainly. If I had more time, I would have designed the Response to look better.
